# Detection Format Specification

## Description

Detection is a format designed to encode the basic information of an earthquake
event Detection.  Detection uses the [JSON standard](http://www.json.org).

## Usage

Detection is intended for use in seismic data messaging between seismic
applications.

## Output

```json
    {
      "Type"        : "Detection",
      "ID"          : String,
      "Source"      :
      {
         "AgencyID" : String,
         "Author"   : String
      },
      "Hypocenter"  :
      {
          "Latitude"        : Number,
          "Longitude"       : Number,
          "Depth"           : Number,
          "Time"            : ISO8601,

          "Certainty" : String
      },
      "Bayes"           : Number,
      "MinimumDistance" : Number,
      "RMS"             : Number,
      "Gap"             : Number,

## Glossary

**Required Values:**

These are the values **required** to define a detection.

* Type - A string that identifies this message as a detection.
* ID - A string containing an unique identifier for this Detection.
* Source - An object containing the source of the Detection, see [Source](Source.md).
* Hypocenter - An object containing the hypocenter of the Detection, see [Hypocenter](Hypocenter.md).

**Optional Values:**

The following are supplementary values that **may or may not** be provided as part of s detection.

* DetectionType - A string that identifies whether the Detection is `New`, `Update`, or `Final`.
* DetectionTime - A string containing the UTC time this detection was made, i.e. how quickly after origin time was this detection created, in the ISO8601 format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ`.
* EventType - An object containing the event type of the correlation, see [EventType](EventType.md).
* Bayes - A decimal number that identifies bayesian statistic for this Detection.
* Sigma - A decimal number indicating the standard deviation of the hypocenter time measurement.
* Data - An array of [Pick](Pick.md), and / or [Correlation](Correlation.md) objects used to generate this Detection.
* MinimumDistance - The minimum distance to the closest station.
* Detector - A string identifying the detection grid, algorithm, or other information.
